# Java Programming Language

《Java 程序设计语言》课程

> Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented,[15] and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA),[16] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. -- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language))
